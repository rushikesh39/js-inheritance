    <h3>
      Create 2 objects - parent and child. Attach methods to parent and use
      those methods in child object using parents prototype
    </h3>
    <pre>
        let parent = {
            fname: "Rushi",
            lname:"Thange",
            fullName : function callMe(){
                console.log(this.fname+'  '+this.lname);
            }
          };
          
          
          let child = {
            __proto__:parent
          }
        child.fullName();
        
    </pre>
    <p>
      The code creates a parent object parent with some properties and a method
      called fullName, which is then inherited by a child object child using the
      __proto__ property.
    </p>
    <p>
      When child.fullName() is called, it searches for fullName property in
      child object. Since child does not have it's own fullName property,
      JavaScript goes up the prototype chain to search for a fullName property
      in its prototype object, which is the parent object in this case. It finds
      the fullName method in the parent object and executes it with this
      referring to the child object. So, the output of the code will be "Rushi
      Thange", which is the result of executing console.log(this.fname+'
      '+this.lname); inside the fullName method.

    <h3>Write code to explain prototype chaining</h3>
    <pre>
        let GrandParent={
            fName:'Rushikesh'
        }
        let Parent={
            mName:'Ramdas',
            __proto__:GrandParent
        }
        let Child={
            lName:'Thange',
            __proto__:Parent
        
        } 
        console.log(Child.fName+" "+Child.mName+" "+Child.lName)
        
    </pre>
    <p>
      GrandParent object has a property called fName with a value "Rushikesh".
      Parent object has a property called mName with a value "Ramdas" and it
      inherits the fName property from its prototype object GrandParent.
      Similarly, Child object has a property called lName with a value "Thange"
      and it inherits the mName and fName properties from its prototype objects
      Parent and GrandParent.

    <h3>
      Add a method to calculate sum of all elements in Array in array's protype,
      use that method to calculate sum for multiple arrays
    </h3>
    <pre>
        let calculate = {
            sum: function(arr) {
              let result = 0;
              for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
                result += arr[i];
              }
              console.log(result);
            }
          }
          calculate.sum([1,2,3,4]);
          
    </pre>
    <p>
      The given code defines an object called calculate with a method called
      sum. The sum method takes an array of numbers as input, and calculates
      their sum using a for loop. Finally, it logs the sum to the console.

    <h3>
      Write a JavaScript function to retrieve all the names of object's own and
      inherited properties.
    </h3>
    <pre>
      let obj1={
        name1:'abc'
      }
      let obj2={
        name2:'pqr',
        __proto__:obj1,
        
        
      }
      
      function retrive(){
        console.log('Names',obj2.name1+"  "+obj2.name2)
      }
      retrive()
      
      
      output:-
      Names abc  pqr
    </pre>
    <p>
      This code creates two objects obj1 and obj2, with obj2 inheriting from obj1. The retrive() function logs the value of the name1 and name2 properties of obj2 to the console.
